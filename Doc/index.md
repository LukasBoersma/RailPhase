# RailPhase

This library allows you to write web applications in .NET via FastCGI.
The API is inspired by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Right now, this library has far less features, though.

RailPhase uses [FastCGI for .NET](https://github.com/LukasBoersma/FastCGI) for the FastCGI protocol and adds a lightweight layer of convenience functions. RailPhase is based on .NET 4.5.

This project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/LukasBoersma/RailPhase). Sources are available under the MIT license.
